# fasting-analysis
 This project involves collecting data over a 24-hour fasting period where volunteers go as long as possible without eating. They record when they start and break their fast, as well as their hunger level, craving level, and mood level at the time of starting and breaking the fast.

 ## Setup
- Clone the repository and create a virtual environment.
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the Project
- Preprocess data: `python scripts/preprocess_data.py`
- Train model: `python scripts/train_model.py`
- Evaluate model: `python scripts/evaluate_model.py`
